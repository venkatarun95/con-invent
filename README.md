con-invent
==========

A multiplayer game based on the Conway's Game of Life where players can invent their own machines and design a battleground to go to war! Detailed instructions are available in the pdf file included (sorry for the bad English, but I didn't write all of it).

Running It
==========
The entire client-server duo is made in java. Unfortunately, I have not set up an internet server yet, so you will have to make your own server if you wish to run the program. Running the java program from the terminal should be fairly straightforward if the appropriate version of jre is available. The enclosed shell scripts will guide you in case there is any doubt. 

Note: permit.policy files are enclosed which must be used while invoking the program to tell java that the program needs permissions to access the network. The 'run.sh' in RunnageClient.tar.gz contains the exact comand to run the client.

Happy Inventing!!
